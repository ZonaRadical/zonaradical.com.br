* When a tour participant get's approved/refused, the owner notification is
  marked as read. The actual implemenation is fragile, since it's rely on the
  notification text, and must be made more robust.

* When the day is not informed for the check in field in tour it's must be
  considered equal 1. For now, to be able to sort, I'm creating this date as a
  virtual attribute called check_in in the application. For performance reasons
  this must be changed to be dealt in the database scope.

* Image gallery must be refactored to avoid duplication and also remove tip
  references, since it's being rendered in others contexts too.

* _profile_agency.html.haml is with the image gallery code commented, because
  this functionality isn't presented in feature/tour branch.
