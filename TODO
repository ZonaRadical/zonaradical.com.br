* Code that change models must be removed from controller, for example, the
  create action of ImageGalleriesController contains the following code:
  
    unless params[:gallery_images].nil? || params[:gallery_images][:images].nil?
      params[:gallery_images][:images].each do |i|
        @image_gallery.gallery_images.create image: i
      end
    end
  
  This is something that the model can take care. This also apply to code in
  tips_controller
